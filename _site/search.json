    "text": "Seafood is one of the most widely traded commodities in the global food market. More than a third of the world’s population relies on fish and other seafood as a primary source of protein in their diet, and an estimated 520 million people make their livelihoods through fishing or fishing-related activities.\nUnfortunately, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a major contributor to overfishing worldwide. These activities pose a threat not only to fragile marine ecosystems, but also to food security in coastal communities and regional stability more broadly. The illegal fishing trade has been linked to organized crime, and human rights violations are common when fishing operations are conducted without regulatory oversight.\nNGO FishEye International is a nonpartisan organization charged with understanding the social, political, and economic forces that drive the illegal fishing trade. They have spent the past several years collecting data, which they hope will help them to form a more comprehensive picture of this evolving threat… but they need your help!\nIn mid-April, FishEye International plans to make several of their datasets available to the public, along with a series of questions surrounding illegal fishing and its broader impacts. They’re asking the Visual Analytics community to help them make sense of this often-conflicting data, and to make recommendations for how to proceed.\nThe Group is working on Mini Challenge 3."

    "text": "Mini-Challenge 3: Detect Anomalies\n\nMotivation\nFishEye International, a non-profit focused on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has been given access to an international finance corporation’s database on fishing related companies. In the past, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU (or other “fishy” business). FishEye has transformed the database into a knowledge graph. It includes information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status. FishEye analysts have attempted to use traditional node-link visualizations and standard graph analyses, but these were found to be ineffective because the scale and detail in the data can obscure a business’s true structure.\n\n\nObjective\nWe aim to help FishEye develop a new visual analytics approach to better understand fishing business anomalies and identify anomalies that could indicate a company is involved in IUU using this graph.\n\n\nTasks\nBelow are the tasks that the group is working on:\n\nUse visual analytics to understand patterns of groups in the knowledge graph and highlight anomalous groups.\nUse visual analytics to identify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph.\nDevelop a visual analytics process to find similar businesses and group them. This analysis should focus on a business’s most important features and present those features clearly to the user.\nMeasure similarity of businesses that you group in the previous question. Express confidence in your groupings visually.\nBased on your visualizations, provide evidence for or against the case that anomalous companies are involved in illegal fishing. Which business groups should FishEye investigate further?\nReflection: What was the most difficult aspect of working with this knowledge graph? Did you have the tools and resources you needed to complete the challenge? What additional resources would have helped you?"

    "text": "1. Overview\nThis proposal is to make use of Visual Analytics to understand patterns of groups in the knowledge graph and highlight anomalous groups for VAST Challenge 2023 (Mini-Challenge 3).\n\n\n2. Introduction\nFishEye International is a non-profit organisation which focuses on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. They had believed that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU. After obtaining access to an international database on fishing related companies including information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status, FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate a company is involved in IUU.\n\n\n3. Project Objectives\nFor our project, we aim to achieve the following objectives:\n\nunderstand patterns of groups in the knowledge graph and highlight anomalous groups;\nidentify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph;\ndevelop a visual analytics process to find similar businesses and group them based on important features identified;\nmeasure similarity of the grouped businesses; and\nPresent the case on whether anomalous companies are involved in illegal fishing, and highlight business groups that require further investigations.\n\n\n\n4. Motivation Behind the Tasks\nOur tasks are to assist FishEye in developing a new visual analytics approach to better understand fishing business anomalies. By accurately detecting and understanding anomalies, such as illegal or overfishing activities, the visual analytics approach can contribute to more effective fisheries management. This, in turn, promotes sustainable fishing practices, helps preserve marine ecosystems, and ensures the long-term viability of fish populations.\n\n\n5. Potential Issues & Challenges\n\nIt will be challenging to work on the voluminous data given there are 27,622 nodes and 24,038 edges.\nThe column product_services consists of a wide variety of products and services from different industries. Currently, there is no guidance on the relationship between each products/services and we would need to establish the relevance of the different products/services related to fishing activities and to filter the values accordingly.\nThere is a need to find the correlations of different dimensions such as country, products_services and revenue_omu and see if there are any prevalent patterns. There is lack of context to the data upfront, and we would have to make logical assumptions in our analysis.\nThere is a need to differentiate the type of role that each source and target plays, in order to identify the relationships between the different companies. \n\n\n\nThere are data with character(0), unknown or NA values that would need to be handled in order to make the data analysis more accurate and meaningful. \n\n\n\n6. Relevant Work and Proposed Approach\nWe will adopt the following methodology:\n\nThe group will meet up and brainstorm on the scope of the project as well as the deliverables that are relevant that can be mapped to meet our project objectives.\nData preparation will be carried out using data cleaning techniques to check for missing values, duplicates and inconsistencies in the data format and categorisation, as well as data transformation to mutate and derive suitable data variables for our analysis.\nCarry out data exploration:\n\nIdentifying fishing-related products and services:\nIdentifying Outliers: Focus on outliers or data points that deviate significantly from the expected patterns. Outliers in the relationships between country, products/services, and revenues could indicate irregularities or anomalies in the fishing business. These outliers may help pinpoint areas that require further investigation.\n\nBuild relevant visual network models to illustrate the characteristics of the business entities through the computation of centrality metrics. Establish connections or edges between entities based on their interactions, collaborations, or dependencies. We can consider the following centrality metrices:\n\nBetweenness Centrality: Identifies entities that act as bridges or intermediaries between other entities within the network.\nEigenvector Centrality: Considers both the number and importance of the entities connected to a particular business entity.\nCommunity detection: Explore the potential grouping of entities based on their potential of forming communities.\n\nWith the results of the visualisation plots, analyse and reveal the connectivity (relationship) between the business entities, and to identify abnormalities within the network. The following are some of the proposed areas of our focus.\n\nNetwork analysis on the top x revenue-generating companies to explore the extensiveness of their network reach of these companies.\n\nNetwork analysis on business owners owning more than x companies to identify individuals with diversity of business ventures.\n\nNetwork analysis on company-to-company relationships to help us identify possible abnormalities based on the nature of the target nodes that the source nodes are linked to. The “source’ companies can be determined based on relevancy of their business nature (e.g. fishing-related) using keyword search."
